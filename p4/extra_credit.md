## Query Results Page
- Created a slider for movies with Bootstrap `carousel slide`, two buttons to go previous or next movie to show up
- Slider goes next automatically every 5 seconds when pointer is not focusing it.
- Displayed query results (movie posters) into 4 columns, used Bootstrap
- Styled these movie posters with CSS, with hover effect when user's cursor points to them
- Note: For future implementation, I would add a 5-stars review for each movie to be displayed instead of `HD` element. A new `form` method post so that user enters the amount of stars for the movie being reviewed. Then calculated the amount of stars to be displayed based on the total user's stars average

# ‚úçÔ∏è New Features

## Dark Theme Feature for Users (`header.html`)
- New feature exclusive for logged-in users
- Users can change to dark theme or ligth theme
- Used Ligth theme and Dark theme icon from Bootstrap
- Used `form post` to save the theme mode of an user in the database (header.html)
- Each user has their own theme, modified User in models.py
- The chosen theme is applied for all pages
- When user log out and log in, the page will load the theme they left from previous session
- For this implementation, used inline JS code (script tag) , `current_user` field, and inline CSS (style tag) in header.html
- **Note**: downside, the page reloads everytime theme icon is clicked because of submit `form post`. Future implementation, when clicking on logout, submit `form post` to save user's theme and then logout (maybe), to avoid page reloads and reduce post and get request from database.
